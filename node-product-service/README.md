# Node.js Product Service

## Description
A simple product service providing a list of products and product details.

### Note
There is no .env, because of only PORT(3000) variable, for this demo it would be overkill

## Setup
```bash
npm install
node index.js
```
This will install dependencies and run application on port 3000
